This Project is meant for Educational Purposes/Entertainment only. 
Selling this project or any part of it is illegal. 

The graphics libraries are from Turbo C++, a product from Borland. This product is not offered by Borland anymore, hence I had to include the libraries so that the game is playable.

I wouldn't mind any credit if you plan to include any part of this project in your own projct :) Feel free to contact me by email : fid <at> qatar.cmu.edu
