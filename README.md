# Snake!!!

DOS version of the popular game snake.

This game was written in Turbo C++, a (now obsolete)compiler/ide provided by Borland. This compiler will be required if you want to compile the game from scratch. A binary is included, which can be run using [DosBox](http://www.dosbox.com/). You might need to fiddle with the emulation speed to run the game like it was meant in the old days :)
